            I'm a curious and enthusiastic product designer with a side passion for code and solving user problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started my artistic journey as a kid, drawing comics as a diary, and later joining a UAL to learn Advertising. With product design, I started 6 years ago when I joined a project to work for Wash Doctors, and ever since then I've been very hung up on service design, tech innovations and intuitive UX.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether it's optimising merchant dashboards or simplifying checkout flows, I blend creative problem-solving with rigorous logic.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm constantly learning new things and always get inspired by people around me.
          </p>
